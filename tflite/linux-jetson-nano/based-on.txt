The `libei_debug.a` file was built from: https://github.com/edgeimpulse/TensorRT/commit/4b732ae8c4f3f3046cae64de370b24db44be6a7b using:

```
$ sh docker/build.sh --file docker/ubuntu-cross-aarch64.Dockerfile --tag tensorrt --cuda 10.2
```

The other libraries were pulled from a Jetson Nano directly.
